## protein_modelling
TLDR: This repository is filled with different forms of metric, biophysical parameter, machine learning and parsing scripts which I use in my research to learn more about disordered proteins (in my case, I work on a protein named 4E-BP2).

Longer Description: Historically, gaining insight into the structure of protein molecules has required complicated, expensive and messy laser/wet lab work. However, with the advent of high-computing power, computational simulations and sampling now aid in the grand endeavor of elucidating the structure-function relation governing these essential macromolecules. All proteins are dynamic, but some more than others. Disordered proteins exhibit an extreme amount of conformational fluctuations in order to function. Characterizing this disorder is essential to understanding their physiological role, and thus computational methods have applied an ensemble approach, in which a set of structures (typically ranging from 100-1,000,000 structures!) consistent with the experimental data is employed for us to decipher and analyze. With so many (messy) conformers/data, deriving meaningful insights from our computational model becomes a data science problem.
